# traffic-signal-control-app-android-remote-controller

A SUMO traffic signal remote controller implemented as an Android App! Uhuu! (TraCI4J adapted, transformed into some sort of TraCI4Android and included and a .jar in libs folder)

## What is the point?

The objective here is to exemplify in a fun way how to interact with the SUMO simulation through TraCI, specifically changing the phase of one junction of traffic lights.

## How does it works?
